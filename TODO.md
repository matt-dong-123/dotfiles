# Luvit types for emmylua_ls

- Solution: LLS_Addons OR wait for emmylua_ls's future releases
- Downsides: Extra git submodule OR time
- Fallback: Switch back to lua_ls (slower) OR do nothing (diagnostics will keep showing)

# TPM is unmaintained

- Solution: Create my own plugin manager OR plux OR use git submodules to manually add
- Downsides: Effort OR learning curve OR maintenance
- Fallback: Keep using (maybe will encounter bugs)

# Switch terminal emulators (Wezterm has 1.3k issues on GitHub)

- Solution: Switch to kitty (NOT ghostty, bad font rendering)
- Downsides: Kovid's antics AND worse colors
- Fallback: Keep using (maybe will encounter bugs)
