## Post-Install

<details><summary><b>Enabling the Vimium-C browser extension</b></summary>

1. Install the vimium-c browser extension
   - For Chromium-based browsers, go [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium-c-%E5%85%A8%E9%94%AE%E7%9B%98%E6%93%8D%E4%BD%9C%E6%B5%8F%E8%A7%88%E5%99%A8/hfjbmagddngcpeloejdejnfgbamkjaeg)
   - For Firefox-based browsers, go [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-c/)
2. In the preferences for the extension, click "Import Settings"
3. Choose the file "vimium_c.json" you just installed.
4. That's it!

</details>

<details><summary><b>Enabling textfox</b></summary>

> **Important**
> This is only for Firefox users!

1. Go to about:profiles in firefox, and copy the "Root Directory" path of the profile you want to use
2. Run `install.sh` in the ~/dotfiles/firefox_config
3. Paste the path you copied in step 1 into the script
4. You should be good to go!

> **Note**
> Installing the sidebery extension is recommended, but not required.
> There is also a default config that goes along textfox nicely.

Thanks to @[Sin-cy](https://www.github.com/Sin-cy/) for providing the install.sh template in his own dotfiles!

You can raise issues if you run into any problems and bugs in the install script. I'll try as hard as I can!

**Remember, my dotfiles are for myself, so it might not work for you.**
